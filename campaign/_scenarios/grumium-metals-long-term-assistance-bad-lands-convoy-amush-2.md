##### Briefing

The Lyran seperatists are still sending convoys through the hills west of the coastline. Every convoy that goes “missing” helps the planetary governor and Petterson's reputation, both with salvaged supplies and by diverting seperatists forces. Convoy escorts are starting to get larger now, I would recommend sneaking in a small fast force with support from our new "Hammer" air wing and hitting the seperatists before they can initiate a bigger fight than last time.

##### After-Action Report

Salvaged (exchange) Locust LCT-1L, Locust LCT-3V, Wolfhound WLF-1B to exchange.
