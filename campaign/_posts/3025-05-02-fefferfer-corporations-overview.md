  - Sells a cookie package known as Bullfrog Biscuits, shaped like the Mech
  - Operates on the swamp planet, and while it has tried to export in the past, has not had much luck.
  - Still does decently enough with local markets
- **Aegis Special Food Interests**
  - Subsidiary of AAP, produces the regular food items consumed on a daily basis... even if a lot of people still say the Aegis Protein Tube tastes like swamp water and sadness
  - Created a plague-resistant strain of rice that can be submerged in the swamp water of the planet and survive handily. Many claim this gives it a unique and addicting flavor, but offworld visitors think it tastes like feet.
  - Aegis Rice Cakes are a fantastic source of iron and Vitamin A! Just trust the commercials!
  - **Halligan Home Electronics**
  - From home entertainment to home communications, a lot of their work piggybacks off of Comstar's infrastructure (Comstar gave their blessing for it, so it's all fine... as far as we're aware of)
  - Pioneered a lightweight VR training headset to local militia forces for virtual war-games.
  - Accidentally shorted out local Comstar comms relays with some experimental entertainment devices. Comstar was not happy, but did not deem them a threat to continued operation. The relay was upgraded to handle the extra traffic.
  - Exports to the nearest 9 planets, ensuring a gaming culture that continues to mystify most Great House soldiers that accidentally wander into the cluster. A common quote is 'What do you MEAN you've never played Battlemech Arena?'
- **Battle Circuit Entertainment**
  - Produce training films ("Battle Circuit", "Science Circuit", etc) and large bulky holo simulators for the purpose of military/security training.
  - Mostly stick to educational entertainment and importing but have created some non educational vids... but Halligan often crushes them in sales.
  - Importing of film and TV vids through legal and illegal means.
- **Tanner Textiles Incorporated**
  - Uniforms, sweat-wicking shirts, waterproof garments, TTI has what you need.
  - Provides the standard Swamp Wader uniform used by pilots... at a decent discount.
  - Pretty much supplies at minimum 4 planets worth of clothing imports and exports per standard month.
  - Discovered that a local animal secretes a mucus that acts as a fantastic waterproofing sealant.
