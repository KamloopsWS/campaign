The planet Grumium is at the very southern end of the FRR, a nation that has only just been born. The planet is under assault from Lyran seperatists and DCMS Ronin/Pirate attacks. The governor is loyal to the FRR more for practical financial reasons than for patriotic duty. The governor is a major investor in Grumium Metals Inc. and fears that FRR losing the planet would damaged GMI. GMI is looking for mercenaries for garrison, anti-piracy, and training operations.
